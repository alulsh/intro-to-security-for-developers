                        Developers need to learn more than just how to write secure code.

                        A compromised laptop, weak password, or posting credentials on GitHub can all lead to a breach.

                        > Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise as designers and builders of bridges or buildings—or software—emanates from that responsibility. Only after answering this calling does an engineer build anything, whether bridges or buildings or software.

                        ## Secure Passwords
                        * 16+ characters in length (the longer, the better)
                        * At least 2 lower case, 2 upper case, 2 numbers, and 2 special characters (`!@#$%^&amp;*()`)
                        * So complex you can't memorize it
                        * Unique - shouldn't be used anywhere else
                        * Use [diceware passphrases](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) if you need to memorize a secure passphrase
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        * How do you use passwords you can't remember?
                        * Use a password manager!
                        * **Most important thing you can do for your personal security if you're not already using one.**
                        * Use one that you can easily use on all your devices, including smartphones.

                        ## Password manager benefits
                        * Password managers protect against password reuse and weak passwords.
                        * Easy to change and rotate passwords.
                        * Password audit and breach notification services.
                        * Store more than just passwords - access tokens, 2FA backup codes, security questions, and credit cards.
                        * I recommend [1Password](https://1password.com/), others include [Encryptr](https://spideroak.com/solutions/encryptr), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), and [KeePass](http://keepass.info/).

                        ## Two Factor Authentication (2FA)
                        * Requires a "second factor" or "second step."
                        * Usually a code generated from an app or sent via SMS.
                        * Generated with [Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) or [HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) algorithms.
                        * Someone can't hack your account with just the password, they also need the second factor.
                        * A weak password protected with 2FA is more secure than a complex password alone.
                        * 2FA apps - [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator), [Authy](https://www.authy.com/), and [Duo](https://duo.com/)

                        ## 2FA Backup and Recovery Codes
                        * **Generate and save 2FA backup codes immediately after enabling.**
                        * Securely store in a password manager, safe, or lockbox.
                        * If you lose your phone or get a new one, **you'll lose access to all your 2FA-enabled accounts unless you have your backup codes**.
                        * [1Password comes with a 2FA authenticator](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) - recommended for ease of use and to avoid account lock out.

                        ## Security questions
                        * Don't provide the correct answers to security questions.
                        * Answers to these questions are easy to find out on social media.
                        * Instead store fake answers in your password manager.
                        * Hackers stole security question answers in the [2014 Yahoo! breach](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/time-kill-security-questions-answer-lies/).
