                        ### Software engineers

                        > Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise as designers and builders of bridges or buildings—or software—emanates from that responsibility. Only after answering this calling does an engineer build anything, whether bridges or buildings or software.

                        If we want to call ourselves software **engineers**, then we need to build secure, stable, and reliable software that minimizes harm to others.

                        Furthermore, all people involved in creating software and other computer systems should care about security, stability, privacy, and reliabilty in what we create and maintain.

                        ### Diversity in Security
                        * Women make up only 10% of the infosec workforce per an [ISC2 white paper](https://www.boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2015/09/women-in-security.pdf).
                        * Among the infosec workforce, 20% of women serve in GRC (Governance, Risk, &amp; Compliance) roles vs. 12.5% of men.
                        * Only 7% of infosec workforce is black per [DC Inno](http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2016/03/23/lack-of-diversity-minorities-in-cybersecurity-industry-hiring/).
                        * Only 5% of infosec workforce is hispanic per [DC Inno](http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2016/03/23/lack-of-diversity-minorities-in-cybersecurity-industry-hiring/).

                        ## Types of security
                        * **infosec** = information security
                        * **cybersecurity** vs. **infosec** vs. **information assurance (IA)**
                        * **appsec** = application security
                        * **netsec** = network security
                        * **physical security** = locks, alarm systems, protecting devices from being stolen
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## AIC/CIA Triad
                        * Classic model for thinking about infosec
                        * Usually "CIA triad" but also "AIC triad"
                        * AIC = availability, integrity, confidentiality
                            * **Availability** = systems are online and accessible
                            * **Integrity** = data has not been modified and can be trusted
                            * **Confidentiality** = data is private
                        * Availability is often neglected in infosec, but you can't ensure integrity and confidentiality of data if the system is down.

                        ## DevSecOps
                        * DevSecOps - applying DevOps philosophy to security
                        * Security as code
                        * Self-healing clouds
                        * Compliance operations, not checklists and documentation
                        * Real pentests, not theoretical vulnerabilities and scanners

                        ## Offense vs. Defense
                        * **Pentesting** = penetration testing - finding vulnerabilities in systems
                        * **Red team** = offensive team that pentests systems and breaks things
                        * **Blue team** = defensive team that protects systems and writes secure code

                        * **White hat** = ethical hacker, asks for permission, responsibly discloses vulnerabilities, possibly hired as a pentester
                        * **Black hat** = malicious, doesn't ask for permission, deletes data, asks victims for money
                        * **Gray hat** = nonchalant, may or may not ask for permission, may not report vulnerabilities at all or publicly discloses, hacks just for fun
                        * **Red Hat?** A type of Linux distribution
                    </section>

                        ## Reporting Security Issues
                        * **Full disclosure** - researcher publishes blog post exposing an active security issue on a website or in a desktop application
                        * **Responsible/coordinated disclosure** - researcher notifies organization of security issue and public isn't notified until the organization releases a fix or a patch
                        * **Non-disclosure** - vulnerability information should never be shared with a vendor or only under an NDA
                        * **Bug bounty program** - structured program that encourages security researchers to pentest resources within scope and report security issues for money

                        This guidance is worthy of its own dedicated "Intro to Consumer Security" talk.

                        Instead, I'll quickly point out the most common security issues I see at work, at Meetups, and with friends and family and what you can do to secure your devices and accounts.

                        Developers need to learn more than just how to write secure code.

                        A compromised laptop, weak password, or posting credentials on GitHub can all lead to a breach.

                        * If you must connect, use a VPN service
                        * Frequently update your web browsers - commonly exploited by attackers
                        * Install the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/Https-everywhere) browser plugin
                        * Install an ad blocker like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - lots of malware distributed via ads
                        * Enable [plugin click-to-play](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/edge-to-follow-chromes-lead-make-flash-ads-click-to-play/) - protects against Adobe Flash vulnerabilities

                        * Even better, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or two-step verification (2SV) on every account possible
                        * Use a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) - use for all your passwords, 2FA tokens, credit cards, access tokens, and backup codes
                        * **Immediately store your 2FA backup or recovery codes in a safe place (password manager) after enabling 2FA**
                        * Don't provide real questions to security questions, store fake ones in a password manager - [2014 Yahoo! breach](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/time-kill-security-questions-answer-lies/)

                        * Enable 2FA on your GitHub account.
                        * Encourage your organization to make this required for all members.
                        * Best thing you can do to secure your GitHub account if not already enabled, especially in light of recent [GitHub password reuse attack](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/16/github_accounts_breached_password_reuse_fail/).
                        * Password reuse attack failed if you had 2FA enabled.

                        * Alternatively, [enable Git SSH authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)
                        * **Always use a strong passphrase to encrypt your SSH keys**
                        * A passphrase-less SSH key can be stolen by an attacker to impersonate you

                        * Public vs. private repos
                        * Don't commit credentials or secret access tokens in your code
                        * **Public** access tokens for client-side JavaScript code can be checked in
                        * Store [sensitive information as environment variables](https://12factor.net/config) instead (even for private repos)
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        * Use `git add &lt;file name&gt;` instead of `git add .`
                        * Don't post sensitive information in issues in public GitHub repos.
                        * Repo watchers will get the initial email with your sensitive information even if you later edit the comment on GitHub.com.

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Making Private Repos Public
                        * Look for open or closed issues with sensitive information - scrub comments
                        * Look for previous commits with sensitive information
                        * Use [BFG Repo Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to scrub sensitive data in the codebase
                        * Look at every part of your code and ask yourself - could an attacker cause harm with this information?

                        I posted something sensitive on GitHub!

                        * Take a deep breath.
                        * Just one commit on one branch? Delete the bad commit then force push.
                        * `git rebase -i HEAD~2` to interactive rebase the last 2 commits
                        * Delete the bad commit (`dd` in vim)
                        * Force push
                            * `git origin push &lt;branch name&gt; --force-with-lease`
                        * More than one commit? Check out [BFG Repo Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).
                        * If credentials, revoke or rotate the compromised ones.

                        ## Gist Security
                        * Private Gists are **security by obscurity** - anyone with the URL can see
                        * If something is extremely sensitive, don't store it in a private Gist at all
                        * Public Gists are posted to the top of the public [discover gists](https://gist.github.com/discover) page
                        * Hackers and black hats have tools to mine public Gists for access tokens and credentials
                        * Assume any sensitive information in a public Gist has been compromised
                        * [Gist command line tools](https://github.com/defunkt/gist) are public by default - avoid using

                        ## Global `.gitignore`
                        * A robust global `.gitignore` file can help prevent accidentally checking in sensitive files
                        * Global `.gitignore` applies to all repos
                        ```
                        git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
                        ```
                        * For Node development on a Mac, recommend adding `*.log` (to prevent `npm-debug.log` files), `node_modules` folder, and `.DS_Store`
                        * [Useful gitignore templates from GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore), including [Node](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore), [Mac](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/macOS.gitignore), [Windows](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Windows.gitignore), [vim](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Vim.gitignore), and [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore).

                        ## CI security
                        * Don't store sensitive information such as credentials or access tokens in your repo's `.travis.yml` file, even for private repos
                        * Encrypt sensitive information using the Travis CI ruby gem:
                        ``` sh
                        gem install travis
                        travis encrypt SECRETVARIABLE=supersecretvalue
                        ```
                        * See the [Travis CI encryption docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/) for more information.
                        * For CircleCI, check out the [encrypted-files](https://github.com/circleci/encrypted-files) project

                        ## Npm security
                        * By default npm requires root access to install packages globally
                        * `sudo npm install -g &lt;package name&gt;`
                        * Never run `sudo npm install` - package **could** contain malicous code
                        * Malicious rimrafall package [reported by Lift Security](https://blog.liftsecurity.io/2015/01/27/a-malicious-module-on-npm) in 2015
                            * `rm -rf /*` preinstall hook
                        * To avoid using `sudo`, install Node with a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), the node version manager

                        ## More npm security
                        * If you are suspicious of a package, install with `npm install --ignore-scripts`
                        * Mitigates a [package install vulnerability](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141702881055/package-install-scripts-vulnerability) that could in theory cause a worm
                        * Remove old contributors from your npm packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) - they can still publish new versions that could contain malicious code

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Dependency management
                        * Older versions of client-side JavaScript libraries and server-side Node packages may contain security vulnerabilities
                        * Node Security Project (nsp) [maintains a list of vulnerabilities](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories)
                        * Use tools like [nsp](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) (Node only) and [retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js) (client-side and Node) to identify vulnerable dependencies
                        * Don't use old libraries or modules - attackers will Google the library and look for published security issues then attack your site.
                        * Consider adding nsp or retire.js as a step in your test (`npm test`) process

                        * PKI = Public Key Infrastructure
                        * HTTPS uses PKI, specifically asymmetric public key cryptography
                        * Asymmetric = private keys (secret) and public keys (shared)
                        * Keys shared with secure key exchange algorithms (RSA, Diffie-Hellmen, elliptical curve)
                        * Digital certificates issued by certificate authorities verify identity

                        ## How do you configure SSL/TLS?
                        * Buy a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA)
                            * Domain Validated (DV), Organization Validated (OV), Extended Validation (EV)
                        * [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
                            * Free, automated, and open CA

                        ## Generate a self-signed cert with OpenSSL

                        OpenSSL `req` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR)

                        ```sh
                        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj '/C=US/ST=DC/O=MyOrganization' -nodes

                    <section data-markdown>
                        * `-x509` - output self-signed certificate instead of CSR
                        * `-newkey rsa:2048` - 2048 bit RSA private key
                        * `-keyout privatekey.pem` - private key
                        * `-out cert.pem` - self signed certificate
                        * `-subj` - subject name for certificate
                        * `-days 365` - key is valid for a year
                        * `-nodes` - private key is un-encrypted without a passphrase (**development only**)

                        Add to your app's `package.json` as a script

                          "scripts": {
                            "cert": "openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj '/C=US/ST=DC/O=MyOrganization' -nodes",
                          },
                        ```

                        To generate new self-signed certs for development:
                        ```sh
                        npm run cert
                        ```

                        You should see two new files - `privatekey.pem` and `cert.pem`

                        ## What's XSS?
                        * Attackers injecting malicious code, usually JavaScript, into your website
                        * XSS payload = malicious code or JavaScript
                        * Treating user-provided data or input as trusted and not potentially malicious

                        ## Types of XSS

                        * Where is the vulnerable code?
                            * Server-side - server XSS
                            * Client-side - client XSS or DOM-based XSS
                        * How is the payload triggered?
                            * Stored or persistent XSS
                            * Reflected XSS
                            * Self-XSS

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Stored XSS
                        * Attacker injects script into a website's database
                        * e.g. attacker pastes payload into a comment on a forum, which is saved in the thread
                        * Malicious JavaScript executed **every time victims visit the page**
                        * Usually server XSS, unable to find real life stored client XSS examples (if you know one, tell me!)
                        * Real life example - [Stored XSS in Veris member portal](https://hackerone.com/reports/118950)
                        * Payload - `&lt;svg onload=alert(1)&gt;`

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Reflected XSS
                        * Victim clicks on link crafted to execute payload on page load, e.g. link in a phishing email or social media post
                        * Either server XSS or client XSS
                        * Real-life example - [Reflected XSS in scores.ubnt.com](https://hackerone.com/reports/130889)
                        * Payload - `https://scores.ubnt.com/form.html?uid=1&amp;p=airFiber"&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;`

                        ### Client XSS
                        * Also referred to as DOM-based XSS
                        * Insecure client-side JavaScript code
                        * Often but not always also reflected XSS
                        * Commonly seen with insecure use of `innerHTML` or templates (underscore, EJS)

                        * Websites may block `&lt;script&gt;` tags, but may allow rich HTML content including `&lt;img&gt;` and `&lt;svg&gt;`
                        * `onerror` attribute executes JavaScript when image fails to load

                        ### How to prevent client XSS
                        <!-- To Do: Explain HTML escaping -->
                        * HTML escape user provided data before adding to the DOM
                        * HTML escaping &gt; sanitization
                        * Attackers will find ways to get around sanitization libraries
                        * Recommend [lodash escape function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.16.3#escape) `_.escape()`
                        * Don't use `textContent` or `createTextNode` to [escape HTML](http://benv.ca/2012/10/02/you-are-probably-misusing-DOM-text-methods/)
                        * Use HTML escaped [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) templates, as seen in [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/#template)
                            * `&lt;%-` instead of `&lt;%=` or `<%`
                            * Real-life example: [Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) on api.tiles.mapbox.com](https://hackerone.com/reports/135217)

                            * `&lt;a href="url"` not `&lt;a href=url`
                        * Avoid using `innerHTML` to add user-provided data to the DOM
                            * Instead create the DOM elements manually (_artisanal DOM elements_)
                            * Real life example: [XSS in L.mapbox.shareControl in mapbox.js](https://hackerone.com/reports/99245)

                        * If you need an authentication system for your website, don't roll your own code, instead use someone else's.
                        * [Passport module](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) - supports 300+ authentication methods
                        * [passport-local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) - basic authentication, username and password
                        * OAuth: [Google](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth), [Facebook](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-facebook), [Twitter](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-twitter), [GitHub](https://github.com/cfsghost/passport-github)
                        * [TOTP](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-totp) (for 2FA!), [SAML](https://github.com/bergie/passport-saml), [JWT](https://github.com/themikenicholson/passport-jwt), [OpenID](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-openid), and more

                        ## Password Security
                        * **Never store unencrypted, plain text passwords in your database**
                        * http://howtosafelystoreapassword.com/
                        * Store a hash of the password, not the password itself.
                        * The hash is one-way - the same password string produces the same hash value and can't be reversed
                        * Bcrypt, PBKDF2, and scrypt are [all secure options for hashing passwords](https://blog.agilebits.com/2015/03/30/bcrypt-is-great-but-is-password-cracking-infeasible/)
                        * "Don't write your own crypto" - it won't be as secure

                        ## Salting Passwords
                        * If two users have the same password in your database, then an attacker can reverse engineer the hash.
                        * Adding a **salt** - a unique random string - makes each hash truly random, even if two users have the same password.
                        * [Use long salts](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm).
                        * Never reuse a salt - every account should have a unique salt.

                        ## Using Bcrypt in Node

                        Easily salt and hash a password securely in Node using the [bcrypt module](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js).

                        ```js
                        var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
                        var password = 'supersecurepassword'
                        var saltRounds = 10;

                        bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
                            // Code to store password in your database
                        });
                        ```
                        The password would never be hardcoded and would instead be received directly from an endpoint.

                        ## Secure Cookies
                        * Cookie = user information written to a text file, e.g. shopping cart information
                        * Often used for user authentication as a session cookie
                        * Cookies are frequently the target of XSS attacks, if stolen can be used to hijack a user's session
                        * `secure` flag - cookie can only be sent over HTTPS, not HTTP
                        * `httpOnly` flag - cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript (important for XSS)
                        * Setting `httpOnly` flag **will** break any JavaScript that relies on access to cookies

                            }
                        }));

                        ## OAuth security
                        Implementing OAuth is beyond the scope of this presentation, but always use the `state` parameter when building OAuth solutions. For passport modules, this should be as easy as adding `state: true` to your strategy.

                        This protects against CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) attacks.

                        See the [GitHub OAuth documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#1-redirect-users-to-request-github-access) for an example.

                        ## Fingerprinting
                        * Before attacking a target, attackers will try to find out as much information as possible via **fingerprinting**.
                        * Easier to hack a system if you know it's architecture or what software it's running
                        * Easier to social engineer a company if you know the people in it
                        * Attackers get info from your website, blog posts, employees social media posts, open source code, and HTTP headers.

                        ## Banner Grabbing
                        * Finding out website software and architecture information from HTTP headers
                        * Command line tools like `nc` (netcat) or `curl`
                        ```sh
                        curl -I www.alexandra.ulsh
                        ```
                        * Response includes `X-GitHub-Request-Id: 17EB2E2E:40D2:191BAD2C:57F7AFBE`
                        * Attacker now knows it's a GitHub Pages site
                        * Programmatic information disclosure is particularly dangerous - attackers can automate attacks

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Preventing Information Disclosure
                        * Disable HTTP headers that reveal software names and versions.
                        * There is no benefit to leaving these headers up, and removing them may even benefit performance.
                        * Don't run production servers in debug or verbose mode
                        * Don't display stack traces or detailed errors to users
                        * Disable directory listing
                        * Don't leave sensitive information in HTML or JavaScript comments

                        ## Preventing Disclosure in Express
                        * By default Express displays the `X-Powered-By: Express` header
                        * Disable using `app.disable('x-powered-by');`
                        * The default cookie name in Express is `connect.sid`
                        * Use a generic name like `session` instead of the default name
                        ```js
                        app.use(session({
                            secret: 't0ps3cr3t',
                            name: 'session'
                            })
                        );
                        ```
                        <!-- Possible to do: code sample and example with X-Powered-By header -->

                        * Taking a system offline and rendering it unavailable to its users
                        * Can be triggered by one illogical payload or multiple high-volume requests
                        * Real life example: [Denial of service in account statistics endpoint](https://hackerone.com/reports/136221)
                        * DoS condition triggered by requesting a large period of time for account statistics - 20 years of (non-existent) data!
                        * Resolved by adding a limit to endpoint to not request more than a year of data

                        * To mitigate DoS conditions, validate user input and add reasonable limits to your application logic.
                        * Don't allow users to provide or request:
                            * data from unlimited time periods
                            * negative values
                            * strings when it should be a number
                            * code or specal characters (null bytes) when it should be text
                        * Limit the size of user uploads (e.g. 20mb)
                        * Build resilient, scalable systems that stay online when 1 server goes offline

                        * CAPTCHA - human completes CAPTCHA before logging in
                        * Rate limit - limit requests to endpoint to 10 request/minute (ok for humans)
                        * Account lockout not desirable as this prevents legitimate users from accessing their account
                        * Also allows attackers to intentionally lockout victims

                        The [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) Express module easily sets common security-related HTTP headers for your server
                        ```js
                        var express = require('express')
                        var helmet = require('helmet')
                        var app = express()

                        app.use(helmet())
                        ```

                        ## Code sample
                        Follow along with the code sample in the `helmet` directory

                        ```sh
                        git clone git@github.com:alulsh/intro-to-security-for-developers.git

                        | `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` | `off` | [Prevent DNS lookups before a user clicks a link](https://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/dns-prefetching) |

                        ### More Default Helmet Headers
                        | Header | Value | Purpose |
                        |---|---|
                        | `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | [Prevents browser from guessing MIME type](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg622941%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) |

                        ## HSTS
                        * Helmet also enables HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers by default
                        * HSTS tells browsers to only load the website over HTTPS
                        * `Strict-Transport-Security:max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
                        * Unfortunately, first initial visit to the site may be over HTTP
                        * Mitigated by adding your domain to Google's preload list at https://hstspreload.appspot.com/.
                        * **Warning** - preloading is a "one way street" and [may break older sites](https://scotthelme.co.uk/using-security-features-to-do-bad-things/), proceed with caution
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Non-Default Helmet Headers
                        * `Cache-Control` - disables caching of client side content
                        * `Referer` - hides the website that referred the user to yours, helps protect privacy
                        * Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
                        * HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) headers
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ## Content Security Policy (CSP)
                        * Protects against XSS by creating strict allowed lists for scripts, fonts, css, forms, plugins, and other resources
                        * Only load scripts from my domain and api.mapbox.com, and fonts from my domain and Google Fonts
                            * `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' api.mapbox.com; font-src 'self' fonts.google.com;`
                        * CSP is buggy and can break things, try with reporting only at first
                        * Excellent [write up on CSP at HTML5 Rocks](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/)

                        ## HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP)
                        * HPKP specifies that only certain pinned key can be used to connect to your site for a specified period of time
                            * `Public-Key-Pins` and `public-key-pins-report-only` headers
                        * Protects against attackers compromising an entire Certificate Authority (CA)
                        * HPKP suicide - incorrectly configuring HPKP so as to lock out your website for months
                        * [RansomPKP](https://scotthelme.co.uk/using-security-features-to-do-bad-things/) - an attacker compromises your servers and commits HPKP suicide

                        ## Summary
                        * Helmet is an easy way to increase the security of your Express website
                        * Use HSTS with caution, especially preloading
                        * Creating a comprehensive CSP is worth it, but start with report only
                        * Use HPKP with caution and start with report only
