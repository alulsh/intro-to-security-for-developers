                        * Use a strong and long (12+) alphanumeric passcode
                        * If you want to only use numbers, then at least use more than 8 numbers
                        * Require a passcode immediately after sleep
                        * iPhone: Enable erase data after 10 bad passcode attempts (take backups!)
                        * iPhone: If you are truly paranoid, don't enable [Touch ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201371)
