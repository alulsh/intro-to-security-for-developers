            ### Software engineers > Engineers bear a burden to the public, and
            their specific expertise as designers and builders of bridges or
            buildings—or software—emanates from that responsibility. Only after
            answering this calling does an engineer build anything, whether
            bridges or buildings or software. ["Programmers: Stop Calling
            Yourselves

          <section data-markdown>
            If we want to call ourselves software **engineers**, then we need to
            build secure, stable, and reliable software that minimizes harm to
            others. Furthermore, all people involved in creating software and
            other computer systems should care about security, stability,
            privacy, and reliability in what we create and maintain.

            paper](https://www.boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2015/09/women-in-security.pdf).
            * Among the infosec workforce, 20% of women serve in GRC
            (Governance, Risk, &amp; Compliance) roles vs. 12.5% of men. * Only
            7% of infosec workforce is black per [DC

            ## Types of security * **infosec** = information security *
            **cybersecurity** vs. **infosec** vs. **information assurance (IA)**
            * **appsec** = application security * **netsec** = network security
            * **physical security** = locks, alarm systems, protecting devices
            from being stolen
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## AIC/CIA Triad * Classic model for thinking about infosec *
            Usually "CIA triad" but also "AIC triad" * AIC = availability,
            integrity, confidentiality * **Availability** = systems are online
            and accessible * **Integrity** = data has not been modified and can
            be trusted * **Confidentiality** = data is private * Availability is
            often neglected in infosec, but you can't ensure integrity and
            confidentiality of data if the system is down.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## DevSecOps * DevSecOps - applying DevOps philosophy to security *
            Security as code * Self-healing clouds * Compliance operations, not
            checklists and documentation * Real pentests, not theoretical
            vulnerabilities and scanners * http://www.devsecops.org/
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Offense vs. Defense * **Pentesting** = penetration testing -
            finding vulnerabilities in systems * **Red team** = offensive team
            that pentests systems and breaks things * **Blue team** = defensive
            team that protects systems and writes secure code

            permission, responsibly discloses vulnerabilities, possibly hired as
            a pentester * **Black hat** = malicious, doesn't ask for permission,
            deletes data, asks victims for money * **Gray hat** = nonchalant,
            may or may not ask for permission, may not report vulnerabilities at
            all or publicly discloses, hacks just for fun * **Red Hat?** A type
            of Linux distribution
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Reporting Security Issues * **Full disclosure** - researcher
            publishes blog post exposing an active security issue on a website
            or in a desktop application * **Responsible/coordinated disclosure**
            - researcher notifies organization of security issue and public
            isn't notified until the organization releases a fix or a patch *
            **Non-disclosure** - vulnerability information should never be
            shared with a vendor or only under an NDA * **Bug bounty program** -
            structured program that encourages security researchers to pentest
            resources within scope and report security issues for money

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Laptops * Lock your screen when you step away from your laptop *
            Use a complex password on your laptop and require a password on wake
            * Encrypt your hard drive using
            [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) (Mac),
            [BitLocker](http://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10)

            [LUKS](http://www.pavelkogan.com/2014/05/23/luks-full-disk-encryption/)
            (Linux) * Enable a firewall on your computer * Update your operating
            system and applications frequently, especially security patches
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Smartphones * Use a long passcode on your smartphone (8+
            characters), preferably alphanumeric * Android: don't use [common
            lock
            patterns](http://www.androidauthority.com/lock-pattern-predictable-636267/)
            * Enable Find My iPhone or Android Device Manager (for remote wipe)
            * Update your operating system and apps frequently, especially
            security patches
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Internet Security * Don't connect to unencrypted (passwordless)
            wifi networks * If you must connect, use a VPN service * Frequently
            update your web browsers - commonly exploited by attackers * Install
            the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/Https-everywhere) browser
            plugin * Install an ad blocker like [uBlock
            Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - lots of malware
            distributed via ads * Enable [plugin
            click-to-play](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/04/edge-to-follow-chromes-lead-make-flash-ads-click-to-play/)

            ## Account Security * Use a strong password - [long (16+ characters)
            with special
            characters](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542576/youve-been-misled-about-what-makes-a-good-password/)
            * Even better, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or two-step
            verification (2SV) on every account possible * Use a password
            manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) - use for all your
            passwords, 2FA tokens, credit cards, access tokens, and backup codes
            * **Immediately store your 2FA backup or recovery codes in a safe
            place (password manager) after enabling 2FA** * Don't provide real
            questions to security questions, store fake ones in a password
            manager - [2014 Yahoo!

            ## GitHub Account Security * Enable 2FA on your GitHub account. *
            Encourage your organization to make this required for all members. *
            Best thing you can do to secure your GitHub account if not already
            enabled, especially in light of recent [GitHub password reuse
            attack](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/16/github_accounts_breached_password_reuse_fail/).

            ## Repository Security * Public vs. private repos * Don't commit
            credentials or secret access tokens in your code * **Public** access
            tokens for client-side JavaScript code can be checked in * Store
            [sensitive information as environment
            variables](https://12factor.net/config) instead (even for private
            repos)

            * Use `git add &lt;file name&gt;` instead of `git add .` * Don't
            post sensitive information in issues in public GitHub repos. * Repo
            watchers will get the initial email with your sensitive information
            even if you later edit the comment on GitHub.com. * GitHub issue
            titles are forever.

            ## Making Private Repos Public * Look for open or closed issues with
            sensitive information - scrub comments * Look for previous commits
            with sensitive information * Use [BFG Repo
            Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to scrub
            sensitive data in the codebase * Look at every part of your code and
            ask yourself - could an attacker cause harm with this information?

            I posted something sensitive on GitHub! * Just one commit on one

            ## Gist Security * Private Gists are **security by obscurity** -
            anyone with the URL can see * If something is extremely sensitive,
            don't store it in a private Gist at all * Public Gists are posted to
            the top of the public [discover
            gists](https://gist.github.com/discover) page * Hackers and black
            hats have tools to mine public Gists for access tokens and
            credentials * Assume any sensitive information in a public Gist has
            been compromised * [Gist command line
            tools](https://github.com/defunkt/gist) are public by default -
            avoid using

            ## Global `.gitignore` * A robust global `.gitignore` file can help
            prevent accidentally checking in sensitive files * Global
            `.gitignore` applies to all repos ``` git config --global
            core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global ``` * For Node development on
            a Mac, recommend adding `*.log` (to prevent `npm-debug.log` files),
            `node_modules` folder, and `.DS_Store` * [Useful gitignore templates
            from GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore), including

            ## CI security * Don't store sensitive information such as
            credentials or access tokens in your repo's `.travis.yml` file, even
            for private repos * Encrypt sensitive information using the Travis
            CI ruby gem: ``` sh gem install travis travis encrypt
            SECRETVARIABLE=supersecretvalue ``` * See the [Travis CI encryption
            docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/) for more
            information. * For CircleCI, check out the

            ## Npm security * By default npm requires root access to install
            packages globally * `sudo npm install -g &lt;package name&gt;` *
            Never run `sudo npm install` - package **could** contain malicous
            code * Malicious rimrafall package [reported by Lift
            Security](https://blog.liftsecurity.io/2015/01/27/a-malicious-module-on-npm)
            in 2015 * `rm -rf /*` preinstall hook * To avoid using `sudo`,
            install Node with a tool like
            [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), the node version manager
          </section>

            ## More npm security * If you are suspicious of a package, install
            with `npm install --ignore-scripts` * Mitigates a [package install
            vulnerability](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141702881055/package-install-scripts-vulnerability)
            that could in theory cause a worm * Remove old contributors from
            your npm packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) - they can
            still publish new versions that could contain malicious code * Add
            `private: true` to the `package.json` of private Node projects to
            prevent accidental publishes to npmjs.com
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Dependency management * Older versions of client-side JavaScript
            libraries and server-side Node packages may contain security
            vulnerabilities * Node Security Project (nsp) [maintains a list of
            vulnerabilities](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories) * Use tools
            like [nsp](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) (Node only) and
            [retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js) (client-side and
            Node) to identify vulnerable dependencies * Don't use old libraries
            or modules - attackers will Google the library and look for
            published security issues then attack your site. * Consider adding
            nsp or retire.js as a step in your test (`npm test`) process

          <section data-markdown>
            * `-x509` - output self-signed certificate instead of CSR * `-newkey
            rsa:2048` - 2048 bit RSA private key * `-keyout privatekey.pem` -
            private key * `-out cert.pem` - self signed certificate * `-subj` -
            subject name for certificate * `-days 365` - key is valid for a year
            * `-nodes` - private key is un-encrypted without a passphrase
            (**development only**)

            Self-XSS
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Stored XSS * Attacker injects script into a website's database *
            e.g. attacker pastes payload into a comment on a forum, which is
            saved in the thread * Malicious JavaScript executed **every time
            victims visit the page** * Usually server XSS, unable to find real
            life stored client XSS examples (if you know one, tell me!) * Real
            life example - [Stored XSS in Veris member
            portal](https://hackerone.com/reports/118950) * Payload - `&lt;svg

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ### Reflected XSS * Victim clicks on link crafted to execute payload
            on page load, e.g. link in a phishing email or social media post *
            Either server XSS or client XSS * Real-life example - [Reflected XSS

            ### How to prevent client XSS
            <!-- To Do: Explain HTML escaping -->
            * HTML escape user provided data before adding to the DOM * HTML
            escaping &gt; sanitization * Attackers will find ways to get around
            sanitization libraries * Recommend [lodash escape
            function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.16.3#escape) `_.escape()` *
            Don't use `textContent` or `createTextNode` to [escape
            HTML](http://benv.ca/2012/10/02/you-are-probably-misusing-DOM-text-methods/)
            * Use HTML escaped
            [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation)
            templates, as seen in
            [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/#template) * `&lt;%-` instead
            of `&lt;%=` or `<%` * Real-life example: [Reflected cross-site
            scripting (XSS) on

          <section data-markdown>
            ### More client XSS mitigations * [Quote your HTML attribute
            values](http://wonko.com/post/html-escaping) * `&lt;a href="url"`
            not `&lt;a href=url` * Avoid using `innerHTML` to add user-provided
            data to the DOM * Instead create the DOM elements manually
            (_artisanal DOM elements_) * Real life example: [XSS in

            ## Passport Module * If you need an authentication system for your
            website, don't roll your own code, instead use someone else's. *
            [Passport module](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) -
            supports 300+ authentication methods *
            [passport-local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) -
            basic authentication, username and password * OAuth:

            ## Password Security * **Never store unencrypted, plain text
            passwords in your database** * http://howtosafelystoreapassword.com/
            * Store a hash of the password, not the password itself. * The hash
            is one-way - the same password string produces the same hash value
            and can't be reversed * Bcrypt, PBKDF2, and scrypt are [all secure
            options for hashing
            passwords](https://blog.agilebits.com/2015/03/30/bcrypt-is-great-but-is-password-cracking-infeasible/)
            * "Don't write your own crypto" - it won't be as secure
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Salting Passwords * If two users have the same password in your
            database, then an attacker can reverse engineer the hash. * Adding a
            **salt** - a unique random string - makes each hash truly random,
            even if two users have the same password. * [Use long
            salts](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm). * Never reuse
            a salt - every account should have a unique salt.

            ## Using Bcrypt in Node Easily salt and hash a password securely in
            Node using the [bcrypt
            module](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js). ```js var
            bcrypt = require('bcrypt'); var password = 'supersecurepassword' var
            saltRounds = 10; bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, function(err,
            hash) { // Code to store password in your database }); ``` The
            password would never be hardcoded and would instead be received
            directly from an endpoint.

            ## Secure Cookies * Cookie = user information written to a text
            file, e.g. shopping cart information * Often used for user
            authentication as a session cookie * Cookies are frequently the
            target of XSS attacks, if stolen can be used to hijack a user's
            session * `secure` flag - cookie can only be sent over HTTPS, not
            HTTP * `httpOnly` flag - cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript
            (important for XSS) * Setting `httpOnly` flag **will** break any
            JavaScript that relies on access to cookies
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Code Example - Cookies ```js var app = express(); var session =
            require('express-session'); app.use(session({ secret: 'shibe memes',
            cookie: { secure: true, httpOnly: true, domain: 'alexandraulsh.com'
            } })); ```

            ## OAuth security Implementing OAuth is beyond the scope of this
            presentation, but always use the `state` parameter when building
            OAuth solutions. For passport modules, this should be as easy as
            adding `state: true` to your strategy. This protects against CSRF
            (Cross Site Request Forgery) attacks. See the [GitHub OAuth
            documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#1-redirect-users-to-request-github-access)
            for an example.

            ## Information Disclosure Revealing more information than necessary
            about the configuration of your system or software.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Fingerprinting * Before attacking a target, attackers will try to
            find out as much information as possible via **fingerprinting**. *
            Easier to hack a system if you know it's architecture or what
            software it's running * Easier to social engineer a company if you
            know the people in it * Attackers get info from your website, blog
            posts, employees social media posts, open source code, and HTTP
            headers.
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Banner Grabbing * Finding out website software and architecture
            information from HTTP headers * Command line tools like `nc`
            (netcat) or `curl` ```sh curl -I www.alexandraulsh.com ``` *
            Response includes `X-GitHub-Request-Id:
            17EB2E2E:40D2:191BAD2C:57F7AFBE` * Attacker now knows it's a GitHub
            Pages site * Programmatic information disclosure is particularly
            dangerous - attackers can automate attacks
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Preventing Information Disclosure * Disable HTTP headers that
            reveal software names and versions. * There is no benefit to leaving
            these headers up, and removing them may even benefit performance. *
            Don't run production servers in debug or verbose mode * Don't
            display stack traces or detailed errors to users * Disable directory
            listing * Don't leave sensitive information in HTML or JavaScript
            comments
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Preventing Disclosure in Express * By default Express displays
            the `X-Powered-By: Express` header * Disable using
            `app.disable('x-powered-by');` * The default cookie name in Express
            is `connect.sid` * Use a generic name like `session` instead of the
            default name ```js app.use(session({ secret: 't0ps3cr3t', name:
            'session' }) ); ```

            to 10 request/minute (ok for humans) * Account lockout not desirable
            as this prevents legitimate users from accessing their account *

            ## HSTS * Helmet also enables HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
            headers by default * HSTS tells browsers to only load the website
            over HTTPS * `Strict-Transport-Security:max-age=31536000;
            includeSubDomains; preload` * Unfortunately, first initial visit to
            the site may be over HTTP * Mitigated by adding your domain to
            Google's preload list at https://hstspreload.appspot.com/. *
            **Warning** - preloading is a "one way street" and [may break older
            sites](https://scotthelme.co.uk/using-security-features-to-do-bad-things/),

          <section data-markdown>
            ## Non-Default Helmet Headers * `Cache-Control` - disables caching
            of client side content * `Referer` - hides the website that referred
            the user to yours, helps protect privacy * Content Security Policy
            (CSP) headers * HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) headers
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>

            `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' api.mapbox.com; font-src
            'self' fonts.google.com;` * CSP is buggy and can break things, try

          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) * HPKP specifies that only certain
            pinned key can be used to connect to your site for a specified
            period of time * `Public-Key-Pins` and `public-key-pins-report-only`
            headers * Protects against attackers compromising an entire
            Certificate Authority (CA) * HPKP suicide - incorrectly configuring
            HPKP so as to lock out your website for months *
            [RansomPKP](https://scotthelme.co.uk/using-security-features-to-do-bad-things/)
            - an attacker compromises your servers and commits HPKP suicide

            ## Summary * Helmet is an easy way to increase the security of your
            Express website * Use HSTS with caution, especially preloading *
            Creating a comprehensive CSP is worth it, but start with report only
            * Use HPKP with caution and start with report only
