                        Developers need to learn more than just how to write secure code.

                        A compromised laptop, weak password, or posting credentials on GitHub can all lead to a breach.

                        > Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise as designers and builders of bridges or buildings—or software—emanates from that responsibility.

                        ## Secure Passwords
                        * 16+ characters in length (the longer, the better)
                        * At least 2 lower case, 2 upper case, 2 numbers, and 2 special characters (`!@#$%^&amp;*()`)
                        * So complex you can't memorize it
                        * Unique - shouldn't be used anywhere else
                        * Use [diceware passphrases](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) if you need to memorize a secure passphrase

                        * How do you use passwords you can't remember?
                        * Use a password manager!
                        * **Most important thing you can do for your personal security if you're not already using one.**
                        * Use one that you can easily use on all your devices, including smartphones.

                        ## Password manager benefits
                        * Password managers protect against password reuse and weak passwords.
                        * Easy to change and rotate passwords.
                        * Password audit and breach notification services.
                        * Store more than just passwords - access tokens, 2FA backup codes, security questions, and credit cards.
                        * I recommend [1Password](https://1password.com/), others include [Encryptr](https://spideroak.com/solutions/encryptr), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), and [KeePass](http://keepass.info/).

                        ## Two Factor Authentication (2FA)
                        * Requires a "second factor" or "second step."
                        * Usually a code generated from an app or sent via SMS.
                        * Generated with [Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) or [HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) algorithms.
                        * Someone can't hack your account with just the password, they also need the second factor.
                        * A weak password protected with 2FA is more secure than a complex password alone.
                        * 2FA apps - [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator), [Authy](https://www.authy.com/), and [Duo](https://duo.com/)

                        ## 2FA Backup and Recovery Codes
                        * **Generate and save 2FA backup codes immediately after enabling.**
                        * Securely store in a password manager, safe, or lockbox.
                        * If you lose your phone or get a new one, **you'll lose access to all your 2FA-enabled accounts unless you have your backup codes**.
                        * [1Password comes with a 2FA authenticator](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) - recommended for ease of use and to avoid account lock out.

                        * Don't provide the correct answers to security questions.
                        * Answers to these questions are easy to find out on social media.
                        * Instead store fake answers in your password manager.
                        * Hackers stole security question answers in the [2014 Yahoo! breach](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/time-kill-security-questions-answer-lies/).

                        * Asymmetric = private keys (secret) and public keys (shared)
                        * Keys shared with secure key exchange algorithms (RSA, Diffie-Hellmen, elliptical curve)
                        * Digital certificates issued by certificate authorities verify identity

                            * Domain Validated (DV), Organization Validated (OV), Extended Validation (EV) 
                        * [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

                        ## Generate a self-signed cert with OpenSSL

                        OpenSSL `req` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR)

                        ```sh
                        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj '/C=US/ST=DC/O=MyOrganization' -nodes

                        * `-keyout privatekey.pem` - private key
                        * `-out cert.pem` - self signed certificate
                        * `-subj` - subject name for certificate
                        * `-days 365` - key is valid for a year
                        * `-nodes` - private key is un-encrypted without a passphrase (**development only**)
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        Add to your app's `package.json` as a script

                        ```js
                          "scripts": {
                            "cert": "openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj '/C=US/ST=DC/O=MyOrganization' -nodes",
                          },
                        ```

                        To generate new self-signed certs for development:
                        ```sh
                        npm run cert
                        ```

                        You should see two new files - `privatekey.pem` and `cert.pem`
