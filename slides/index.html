                        ## How to: Code Samples

                        * This presentation includes code samples to help teach security concepts interactively.
                        * These must be run locally - they're not on my website.
                        * I use GitHub Pages (can't run Node) and I don't want live vulnerabilities on my domain.
                        * Prerequisites:
                            * [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (preferably install using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
                            * [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
                        * I used Node 4.6.0 and npm 2.15.9, but these samples may work with earlier or later versions of either node/npm
                        * I'm using Node and Express (due to familiarity) - I may explore other languages for other talks.

                        ### Software engineers

                        > Engineers bear a burden to the public, and their specific expertise as designers and builders of bridges or buildings—or software—emanates from that responsibility. Only after answering this calling does an engineer build anything, whether bridges or buildings or software.

                        If we want to call ourselves software **engineers**, then we need to build secure, stable, and reliable software that minimizes harm to others.

                        Furthermore, all people involved in creating software and other computer systems should care about security, stability, privacy, and reliabilty in what we create and maintain.

                        * Women make up only 10% of the infosec workforce per an [ISC2 white paper](https://www.boozallen.com/content/dam/boozallen/documents/2015/09/women-in-security.pdf).
                        * Among the infosec workforce, 20% of women serve in GRC (Governance, Risk, &amp; Compliance) roles vs. 12.5% of men.
                        * Only 7% of infosec workforce is black per [DC Inno](http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2016/03/23/lack-of-diversity-minorities-in-cybersecurity-industry-hiring/).
                        * Only 5% of infosec workforce is hispanic per [DC Inno](http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2016/03/23/lack-of-diversity-minorities-in-cybersecurity-industry-hiring/).

                        * **Black hat** = malicious, doesn't ask for permission, deletes data, asks victims for money
                        * **Gray hat** = nonchalant, may or may not ask for permission, may not report vulnerabilities at all or publicly discloses, hacks just for fun
                        * **Red Hat?** A type of Linux distribution

                        * **Full disclosure** - researcher publishes blog post exposing an active security issue on a website or in a desktop application
                        * **Responsible/coordinated disclosure** - researcher notifies organization of security issue and public isn't notified until the organization releases a fix or a patch
                        * **Non-disclosure** - vulnerability information should never be shared with a vendor or only under an NDA
                        * **Bug bounty program** - structured program that encourages security researchers to pentest resources within scope and report security issues for money

                        * Developers need to learn more than just how to write secure code.
                        * A compromised laptop, weak password, or posting credentials on GitHub can all lead to a breach.

                        ## Account Security
                        * Use a strong password - [long (16+ characters) with special characters](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/542576/youve-been-misled-about-what-makes-a-good-password/)
                        * Even better, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or two-step verification (2SV) on every account possible
                        * Use a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) - use for all your passwords, 2FA tokens, credit cards, access tokens, and backup codes
                        * **Immediately store your 2FA backup or recovery codes in a safe place (password manager) after enabling 2FA**
                        * Don't provide real questions to security questions, store fake ones in a password manager - [2014 Yahoo! breach](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/time-kill-security-questions-answer-lies/)

                        * PKI = Public Key Infrastructure
                        * HTTPS uses PKI, specifically asymmetric public key cryptography
                        * Asymmetric = private keys (secret) and public keys (shared)
                        * Keys shared with secure key exchange algorithms (RSA, Diffie-Hellmen, elliptical curve)
                        * Digital certificates issued by certificate authorities verify identity

                        ## How do you configure SSL/TLS?
                        * Buy a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA)
                            * Domain Validated (DV), Organization Validated (OV), Extended Validation (EV) 
                        * [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
                            * Free, automated, and open CA
                            * Requires shell access to server
                            * Won't work on GitHub Pages websites :(
                        * Development use only - self-signed certificates

                        ## Generate a self-signed cert with OpenSSL

                        OpenSSL `req` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR)

                        ```sh
                        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj '/C=US/ST=DC/O=MyOrganization' -nodes

                        * `-newkey rsa:2048` - 2048 bit RSA private key
                        * `-keyout privatekey.pem` - private key
                        * `-out cert.pem` - self signed certificate
                        * `-subj` - subject name for certificate
                        * `-days 365` - key is valid for a year
                        * `-nodes` - private key is un-encrypted without a passphrase (**development only**)
                    </section>

                        Add to your app's `package.json` as a script

                        ```js
                          "scripts": {
                            "cert": "openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privatekey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -subj '/C=US/ST=DC/O=MyOrganization' -nodes",
                          },
                        ```

                        To generate new self-signed certs for development:
                        ```sh
                        npm run cert
                        ```

                        You should see two new files - `privatekey.pem` and `cert.pem`

                        * Stealing cookies (access to `document.cookie`)
                        * Keyloggers (`addEventListener`)
                        * Phishing (create fake login forms)
                        * Capturing screenshots of user's session

                        ## Types of XSS

                        * Where is the vulnerable code?
                            * Server-side - server XSS
                            * Client-side - client XSS or DOM-based XSS
                        * How is the payload triggered?
                            * Stored or persistent XSS
                            * Reflected XSS
                            * Self-XSS
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Stored XSS
                        * Attacker injects script into a website's database
                        * e.g. attacker pastes payload into a comment on a forum, which is saved in the thread
                        * Malicious JavaScript executed **every time victims visit the page**
                        * Usually server XSS, unable to find real life stored client XSS examples (if you know one, tell me!)
                        * Real life example - [Stored XSS in Veris member portal](https://hackerone.com/reports/118950)
                        * Payload - `&lt;svg onload=alert(1)&gt;`
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Reflected XSS
                        * Victim clicks on link crafted to execute payload on page load, e.g. link in a phishing email or social media post
                        * Either server XSS or client XSS
                        * Real-life example - [Reflected XSS in scores.ubnt.com](https://hackerone.com/reports/130889)
                        * Payload - `https://scores.ubnt.com/form.html?uid=1&amp;p=airFiber"&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;`

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Client XSS
                        * Also referred to as DOM-based XSS
                        * Insecure client-side JavaScript code
                        * Often but not always also reflected XSS
                        * Commonly seen with insecure use of `innerHTML` or templates (underscore, EJS)
                    </section>
                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Code samples
                        Follow along with the code sample in the `xss` directory

                        Requires Node v4.6.0 and npm v2.15.19

                        ```sh
                        git clone git@github.com:alulsh/intro-to-security-for-developers.git
                        cd xss
                        npm install
                        npm start
                        ```
                        Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser

                    <section data-markdown>
                        ### Malicious images
                        * Payload from code sample - `http://localhost:3000/results.html?query=&lt;img src="fake.jpg" onerror=alert(1)&gt;`
                        * Websites may block `&lt;script&gt;` tags, but may allow rich HTML content including `&lt;img&gt;` and `&lt;svg&gt;`
                        * `onerror` attribute executes JavaScript when image fails to load

                        ### Incomplete list of client XSS payloads
                        * `javascript:` protocol - `&lt;IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')&gt;`
                        * body tag - `&lt;BODY ONLOAD=alert('XSS')&gt;`
                        * link tag - `&lt;LINK REL="stylesheet" HREF="javascript:alert('XSS');"&gt;`
                        * CSS URLs - `&lt;DIV STYLE="background-image: url(javascript:alert('XSS'))"&gt;`
                        * [Markdown parsers](https://hackerone.com/reports/82725) - `[Click here](javascript:alert(1))`

                        ### How to prevent client XSS
                        * HTML escape user provided data before adding to the DOM
                        * HTML escaping &gt; sanitization
                        * Attackers will find ways to get around sanitization libraries
                        * Recommend [lodash escape function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.16.3#escape) `_.escape()`
                        * Don't use `textContent` or `createTextNode` to [escape HTML](http://benv.ca/2012/10/02/you-are-probably-misusing-DOM-text-methods/)
                        * Use HTML escaped [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) templates, as seen in [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/#template)
                            * `&lt;%-` instead of `&lt;%=` or `<%`
                            * Real-life example: [Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) on api.tiles.mapbox.com](https://hackerone.com/reports/135217)

                        ### More client XSS mitigations
                        * [Quote your HTML attribute values](http://wonko.com/post/html-escaping)
                            * `&lt;a href="url"` not `&lt;a href=url`
                        * Avoid using `innerHTML` to add user-provided data to the DOM
                            * Instead create the DOM elements manually (_artisanal DOM elements_)
                            * Real life example: [XSS in L.mapbox.shareControl in mapbox.js](https://hackerone.com/reports/99245)
                            * [mapbox.js pull request #1102](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js/pull/1102/files)
                        * Use `X-XSS-Protection` and Content Security Policy headers
